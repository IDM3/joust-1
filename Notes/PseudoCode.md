User will input 4 integers:
    square footage required
    number of rooms
    hourly labor cost
    desired grade of carpet

Search csv files by company name

Search csv files found by date and choose most recent date

Use the desired grade of carpet first to find all values that match it

Find the cheapest possible carpet from the list

Multiply length and width of each carpet starting with cheapest one until you find one that satisfies 
the square footage divided by number of rooms

Once the cheapest carpet that satisfies the square footage of room is found, mark it off and find the next
cheapest until all rooms have been accounted for.

total labor = find sum of number of carpets times half labor cost and number of rooms times half labor cost

total carpet = find sum of prices of the carpets selected

total cost = sum of labor and carpet divided by .6 to include the 40% margin.
